# Converter from .hexpattern to an ingame focus.

In order to get this to work, run init. This can be done with a simple shell command:

``lua wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobi-glitch/Arbitrarypattern--focus/refs/heads/main/init.lua ``

(Sorry the files aren't here. You can find them in the inappropriately named messing-with-overlays)

Now, you'll have a file called pattern.lua. Place your focal port nearby, load it up with some form of iota storage, and execute the file.

Then, paste in the link to your .hexpattern (or any sort of filetype, just formatted *like* a hexpattern.). The code will then execute, writing the hex to the focus.

Thanks!
